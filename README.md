# Sorting Perfromance
  In this project we build an application, using C, to compare performance of the various sorting algorithms.

Performance can be measured by parameters such as-
- Execution time.
- Number of comparisons (for comparison-based sorting algorithms only).
- Number of read and write operations.

We will comparing the given sorting algorithm-
-Bubble Sort
-Merge Sort
-Selection Sort
-Insertion Sort
-Quick Sort
-Counting Sort
