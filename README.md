# Sorting Perfromance
  In this project we build an application, using C, to compare performance of the various sorting algorithms.
  Performance can be measured by parameters such as-
- Execution time.
- Number of comparisons (for comparison-based sorting algorithms only).
- Number of read and write operations.
