Sorting Performance and Representing values graphically.

We were assigned to create different programs in c lanuage, which implemented several sorting algorithms and then calculated the time used by the algorithm in performing the sorting algorithm

Following algorithms were implimented by the team members :
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

Our Next objective is to plot the results graphically using 'Plot.ly'.

Thankyou.
