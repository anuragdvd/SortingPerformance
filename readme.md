Welcome to humblefool club
My Name is Divyanshu Singh 

I was inntially assigned  to create a simple C program which sorts an array provided by the user, and prints the time taken by the algorithm along with printing the array itself.

The Algorithm used was Bubble Sort.
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
Here the algorithm is not optimized for speed, it runs in the most naive form.

Thankyou.
suggestions and corrections are most welcome and appreciated.
